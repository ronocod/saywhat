SayWhat
=======

SayWhat is a HTML5 + JavaScript project I did for my Internet Technologies module in college.

It's a simple game which plays audio clips of sentences in French or Spanish and asks you to guess the English translation of the clip. The audio clips and translations were generated using Google Translate.
